#### Responsibilities
* Ankit Kumar Gupta taken the Frontend of the given problem statement
* Avinash Kumar Pathak taken the Backend of the given problem statement

#### Steps to execute the solution
* First one, we created the registration page of the user. For that we used JSP page and Servlet File. In JSP page, for Frontend we used Html, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and for Backend we used J2EE, MySQL and AJAX. If user added a emailid at the time of registration and that emailid already present in database, then we generate a message with emailid already exist please choose another one, for that we used AJAX technology.
* After successfully registration, We created the login page of the user. For that we used same technologies for Frontend as registration page and for Backend we used J2EE and Mysql.
* Then completion of successfully login we open the user home page otherwise we generate a message for that that is invalid emailid or password. This validation completed using Java Script.
* After successfully login we show the overview of the shopping project with Frontend as well as Backend. For server side programming we used a Navigation Bar given with some required buttons.
* In Navigation Bar we used buttons like as My account, Profile, Add products, Search products using city, View products, Buy products and Logout. 
* According to buttons, they work with server like Add Products used for add to items in the shopping website, Buy products used for purchasing items from website and so on. 
* And the last button Logout  used for security purpose of the user. With this logout, we give another feature to the user that is if user opens some buttons and then he press the logout button, then by the use of browser's back button it will not show the user's working page.
* And another functionality with this if user not working in this page then from we given time interval with 2 minutes and then it will automatically logout out.
